This appendix contains the code used to run the anonymity experiments and analyze the results. The code is organized as follows:
`EXPERIMENT_anonymity_modified_relay_selection.py` is the experiment script ran on the VM simulating our POC and `EXPERIMENT_anonymity_vanilla_relay_selection.py` is the experiment script ran on the VM simulating the vanilla Tor client. 

The file `relay_occurrences_vanilla.csv` contains the relay occurrences for the vanilla Tor client and `relay_occurrences_poc.csv` contains the relay occurrences for our POC. Lastly the file `Tor_onion_Gini.xlsx` contains the data, formulas used and the result of the Gini coefficient and normalized Shannon entropy value.

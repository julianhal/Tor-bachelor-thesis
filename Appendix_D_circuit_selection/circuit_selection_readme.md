This folder represents the unfinished code and experimentation scripts which delve into circuit selection changes in Tor using python and stem. The main idead is to maintain a pool of 5 circuits, measuring their RTT values, continuously creating new circuits and closing unused ones faster than vanilla Tor, and selecting the best circuit based on RTT. More work needs to be done to implement these changes fully, but we include this script here to hopefully inspire future work.
